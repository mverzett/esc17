title: Move semantics
layout: main
category: cpp
---

The goal of this exercise is to get some confidence with move
semantics, in particular to implement the move operations of a class:
the move constructor and the move assignment.

Open the test program
[`string.cpp`]({{site.exercises_repo}}/hands-on/cpp/string.cpp)
and complete the existing code to:

* Complete the set of the special member functions so that String is
  copyable and movable
  
* Add `operator[]` (const and non-const) to access a character at a
  given position

* Add a `c_str()` member function to access the underlying C-style
  string

* Use a smart pointer instead of a raw pointer. Note that
  `std::unique/shared_ptr` and corresponding `make_unique/shared`
  support arrays

The commands to build and run the code are:

    [studentNM@esc-XY ~]$ cd esc17/hands-on/cpp
    [studentNM@esc-XY cpp]$ g++ -o string string.cpp
    [studentNM@esc-XY cpp]$ ./string
